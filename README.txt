Description

Implement an algorithm to schedule drone-carried deliveries to customers in a small town. The
town is organized in a perfect grid, with a warehouse and drone-launch facility at the center. All
deliveries originate at the warehouse and are carried by a drone to a customer location. A drone's
"ground speed" is exactly one horizontal or vertical grid block per minute.
